# DepthRedist

Conditions for the obtained data:

All samples are based on a master sample 300A x 200A x 100A (length x width x depth) bombarded with 2 keV Kr at 60 deg incidence sequentially up to a fluence of ..., which was enough to obtain saturation of the amount of retained Kr. The depth was dynamically adjusted to maintain a value around 100A as atoms were sputtered from the surface. The master sample received a final 900C/2ns anneal.

data - master sample

data_30cut - master sample with top 30A removed

data_relax - master sample, but additional 900C/2ns anneal after each recoil event before displacement is measured.
